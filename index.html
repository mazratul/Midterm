        <p id="myDescription">
          "I am a German-born theoretical physicist who is widely held to be one
          of the greatest and most influential scientists of all time. Best
          known for developing the theory of relativity, I also made important
          contributions to quantum mechanics, and am thus a central figure in
          the revolutionary reshaping of the scientific understanding of nature
          that modern physics accomplished in the first decades of the twentieth
          century. My massâ€“energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from
          relativity theory, has been called "the world's most famous equation".
          I received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for my services to
          theoretical physics, and especially for my discovery of the law of the
          photoelectric effect", a pivotal step in the development of quantum
          theory. My work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of
          science.In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the
          British journal Physics World, I was ranked the greatest physicist of
          all time. My intellectual achievements and originality have made the
          word Einstein broadly synonymous with genius."
